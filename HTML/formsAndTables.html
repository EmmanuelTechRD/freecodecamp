            <h2>How Do Forms, Labels, and Inputs Work in HTML?</h2>
            <!-- example -->
                <p>
                    Forms are elements used to gather information from the user (such as name and
                    email). These rely on input elements to allow the user to fill up
                    information. As an example, the following element represents a form functionality:
                </p>
                <form action="">
                        <input type="text" />
                </form>
                <br>
            <!-- example -->
                <p>
                    Forms support different data types such as regular plain text. We can also add
                    labels to form input elements. Here's a form with a label element that nests
                    an input element creating an implicit association between the label and the input
                    box.
                </p>
                <form action="">
                    <label>
                        Full Name:
                        <input type="text" />
                    </label>
                </form>
                <br>
            <!-- example -->
                <p>
                    There's another way to associate a label with an input element, for this purpose
                    we can use the <code>for=""</code> attribute on the label element, we'll also need to add an <code>id=""</code> 
                    attribute to the input element in order to associate these two elements.
                </p>
                <form action="">
                    <label for="email">Email address:</label>
                    <input type="email" id="email">
                </form>
                <br>
            <!-- example -->
                <p>
                    On the previous example, we also declared the input data as <code>type="email"</code>
                    this allows for this input field to have error validators that are common to check
                    for inaccurate email addresses (If you attempt adding an incomplete email address It'll
                    prompt an error, further indicating what to fix). Now we'll see the <code>placeholder</code>
                    attribute which is used to better indicate the user what type of data is expected by
                    the input element.
                </p>
                <form action="">
                    <label for="email">Email address:</label>
                    <input type="email" id="email" placeholder="esoto@esportfolio.dev">
                </form>

        <section id="section2">
            <h2>What Are the Different Types of Buttons, and When Should You Use Them?</h2>
            <!-- example -->
                <p>
                    The <code>button</code> element is used to perform a particular action when it is clicked
                    by the user. A <code>button</code> with text indicating it's purpose looks like this:
                </p>
                <button>Load more content</button>
            <!-- example -->
                <p>
                    Buttons can be used to trigger different actions such as submitting a form, toggling a side menu
                    open and closed and multiple other functions that can be programed with the help of
                    JavaScript. To use a <code>button</code> with mutiple fuctionalies we should declare a 
                    <code>type=""</code> attribute. Here's an example declaring a button with the <code>type="button"</code>
                    which will trigger a JavaScript programmed alert once clicked.
                </p>
                <button class="alert-btn" type="button">Show Alert</button>
