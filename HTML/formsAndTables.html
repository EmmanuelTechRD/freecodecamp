            <h2>How Do Forms, Labels, and Inputs Work in HTML?</h2>
            <!-- example -->
                <p>
                    Forms are elements used to gather information from the user (such as name and
                    email). These rely on input elements to allow the user to fill up
                    information. As an example, the following element represents a form functionality:
                </p>
                <form action="">
                        <input type="text" />
                </form>
                <br>
            <!-- example -->
                <p>
                    Forms support different data types such as regular plain text. We can also add
                    labels to form input elements. Here's a form with a label element that nests
                    an input element creating an implicit association between the label and the input
                    box.
                </p>
                <form action="">
                    <label>
                        Full Name:
                        <input type="text" />
                    </label>
                </form>
                <br>
            <!-- example -->
                <p>
                    There's another way to associate a label with an input element, for this purpose
                    we can use the <code>for=""</code> attribute on the label element, we'll also need to add an <code>id=""</code> 
                    attribute to the input element in order to associate these two elements.
                </p>
                <form action="">
                    <label for="email1">Email address:</label>
                    <input type="email" id="email1">
                </form>
                <br>
            <!-- example -->
                <p>
                    On the previous example, we also declared the input data as <code>type="email"</code>
                    this allows for this input field to have error validators that are common to check
                    for inaccurate email addresses (If you attempt adding an incomplete email address It'll
                    prompt an error, further indicating what to fix). Now we'll see the <code>placeholder</code>
                    attribute which is used to better indicate the user what type of data is expected by
                    the input element.
                </p>
                <form action="">
                    <label for="email2">Email address:</label>
                    <input type="email" id="email2" placeholder="esoto@esportfolio.dev">
                </form>
                <br>

            <h2>What Are the Different Types of Buttons, and When Should You Use Them?</h2>
            <!-- example -->
                <p>
                    The <code>button</code> element is used to perform a particular action when it is clicked
                    by the user. A <code>button</code> with text indicating it's purpose looks like this:
                </p>
                <button>Load more content</button>
                <br>
                <br>
            <!-- example -->
                <p>
                    Buttons can be used to trigger different actions such as submitting a form, toggling a side menu
                    open and closed and multiple other functions that can be programed with the help of
                    JavaScript. To use a <code>button</code> with mutiple fuctionalies we should declare a 
                    <code>type=""</code> attribute. Here's an example declaring a button with the <code>type="button"</code>
                    which will trigger a JavaScript programmed alert once clicked.
                </p>
                <button class="alert-btn" type="button">Show Alert</button>
                <br>
                <br>
            <!-- example -->
                <p>
                    Another possible value for <code>type</code> attribute within the <code>button</code> element is <code>submit</code>. 
                    A <code>button</code> of <code>type="submit"</code> once clicked sends data to the server to be processed. An example would be:
                </p>
                <form action="" method="post">
                    <label for="email3">Email address:</label>
                    <input type="email" name="email3" id="email3">
                    <button type="submit">Submit Form</button>
                </form>
                <br>
            <!-- example -->
                <p>
                    There's one more value for the <code>type</code> attribute which is <code>reset</code>. 
                    The purpose of this attribute is to erase all inserted data within the form. 
                    This can be useful for the user if they realize they made mistakes while filling up a form. 
                    However, it's important to note that once clicked all introduced data will be permanently 
                    erased and users may mistakenly click this button; therefore is not often included
                    on forms. Here's an example of a form that includes the reset button.
                </p>
                <form action="" method="post">
                    <label for="email4">Email address:</label>
                    <input type="email" name="email4" id="email4">
                    <button type="submit">Submit Form</button>
                    <button type="reset">Reset Form</button>
                </form>
                <br>
            <!-- example -->
                <p>
                    One more thing; another way to create buttons in HTML is by using <code>input</code> elements. 
                    This element also has a <code>type</code> attribute with the same possible values available such as, 
                    <code>submit</code>, <code>reset</code> and <code>button</code>. 
                    A key difference that you should note while using the input element as a button is
                    that it is a void element which doesn't support nesting of other elements, which may
                    reduce versatility of use. Here's an input button which triggers a Javascript fuctionality to
                    display a text to the user.
                </p>
                <input class="start-btn" type="button" value="Start Game" />
                <br>

            <h2>What Is Client-Side Form Validation in HTML Forms, and What Are Some Examples?</h2>
            <!-- example -->
                <p>
                    When a user fills up information in a form, it is important to verify that they
                    are providing all the necessary information in the correct format. This is why
                    form validation is important; it can be enforced both on the front-end layout,
                    on the interface the user interacts with on their browser, as well as on
                    the back-end or server side for added security. One example of form validation
                    is the <code>required</code> attribute with <code>input</code> elements.
                    This attribute specifies that the user needs to fill up an specific form field, 
                    before they are able to send the form. Form validation is also enforced by
                    the field <code>type=""</code> attribute. Here's an example of a <code>type="email"</code>
                    <code>required</code> field (if you try sending the form empty or without an email it will fail).
                </p>
                <form action="">
                    <label for="email5">Email Address (Required field):</label>
                    <input required type="email" name="email5" id="email5">
                    <button type="submit">Submit Form</button>
                </form>
